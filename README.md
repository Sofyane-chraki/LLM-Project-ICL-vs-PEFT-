# LLM-Project-ICL-vs-PEFT-
Here's the repository for the LLM project. Its purpose is to train a Large Language Model (LLM) for question-answering about a specific topic. Additionally, we aim to compare two methods of model training and understand the advantages and drawbacks of each.

The project is structured as follows:

from_pdf_to_csv.py: This file is dedicated to modifying and initially creating our dataset. Originally, its purpose was to extract data in the format of questions and answers and create a CSV file from it.
As we progressed with the project, we modified our dataset to better suit our objectives. This involved adapting the format of the dataset to fit our two methodologies and meet the requirements of the model.

Then we have two jupyter notebook file, each one of them is dedicated for one method.



Finaly we have the dataset in the txt format.
